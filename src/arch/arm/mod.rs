/// Relocation types for ARM 32-bit.
///
/// Based on "ELF for the ARM® Architecture" pdf.
/// Document number: ARM IHI 0044F, current through ABI release 2.10.
/// Date of issue: 24th November 2015.
///
/// The following nomenclature is used for the operation:
/// - S (when used on its own) is the address of the symbol.
/// - A is the addend for the relocation.
/// - P is the address of the place being relocated (derived from r_offset).
/// - Pa is the adjusted address of the place being relocated, defined as (P & 0xFFFFFFFC).
/// - T is 1 if the target symbol S has type STT_FUNC and the symbol addresses a Thumb instruction;
///   it is 0 otherwise.
/// - B(S) is the addressing origin of the output segment defining the symbol S. The origin is
///   not required to be the base address of the segment. This value must always be word-aligned.
/// - GOT_ORG is the addressing origin of the Global Offset Table (the indirection table for imported
///   data addresses). This value must always be word-aligned. See §4.6.1.8, Proxy generating
///   relocations.
/// - GOT(S) is the address of the GOT entry for the symbol S.
